You have discovered my playground.
This repository contains dozens of folders each named after a programming
concept I was exercising at the time.

Most are 5-10 liners, while others are focused endeavors.

Directories:

- arrays - Basic operations with arrays such as applying a filter, appending, and testing the iota incrementer.
- book - Small programs made from following the examples of The Go Programming Language Chapter 1.
- bools - Verifying the behavior of booleans in conditional statements.
- concurrency - Small test involving a goroutine.
- error_handling - Declaration and usage of an error variable.
- file - File operations such as reading, determining size, and checking existence.
- format - String formatting and concatenation.
- gnet - Attempts at using a popular and high performance network framework. 
- greetings - An exercise on Go maps and random index selection.
- hello - One of the first tutorials on go.dev walks you through installing a "greetings" package.
- installing - A remnant from inspecting the "go build" command.
- int_types - Observing the behavior of uint8.
- json_parsing - Marshalling and unmarshalling JSONs, as well as unmarshalling them on structs that weren't defined prior.
- oop - Studying how methods from a base struct can be "inherited".
- package_level_declarations - Studying how functions are imported and used across packages.
- pointers - A review on pointers and their manipulation.
- post_request_json - Basic HTTP POSTing by testing on a Discord webhook URL.
- publishing - Verifying that Go can read environment variables.
- strings - String splitting and checking if a string is empty.
- structs - Exploring structs and making methods with a receiver for those structs.
- tcp - A TCP client and server, based on a tutorial offered by Linode.
- type_declaration - Conversion between floats types that were declared by type alias.
